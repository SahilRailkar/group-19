## Summary of the Project
The goal of our project is to have an agent successfully reach the finish line while avoiding obstacles and collecting gold nuggets to maximize its score. The agent will constantly be moving forward at a speed of 1 block/second. The agent may avoid obstacles by moving 1 block left or right (3 block wide path), crouching, or jumping. The agent will be able to view a 6 x 3 grid (6 blocks ahead and 3 blocks horizontally). The agent has two lives. If the agent runs into an obstacle, it will lose a life and after two hits, it will die.
